# **App Name**: Super Shop

## Core Features:

- Mobile-First Layout with Bottom Navigation: Implement a responsive layout with a fixed bottom navigation bar for mobile (Home, Cart, Orders, Admin) and a top header for desktop.
- Home Page Hero Section: Create a 'Flash Sale' banner at the top of the home page with a countdown timer.
- Category List: Implement a horizontally scrollable list of product categories (e.g., Grocery, Electronics, Fashion).
- Product Grid Display: Display products in a 2-column grid, with each card showing image, title, price (using '৳' symbol), and an 'Add' button.
- Dummy Product Data: Create a `lib/dummyData.js` file with 10 mock product items (e.g., Rice, Oil, Earbuds) to populate the grid.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light blue (#B2EBF2) for a calm, clean aesthetic, reflecting trust and reliability, given the app is for e-commerce.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E0F7FA), subtly tinted from the primary.
- Accent color: Pale green (#B9F6CA) to highlight actionable elements such as buttons, while complementing the primary hue.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif, providing a modern, clean and neutral look appropriate to the mobile-first aesthetic.
- Use Lucide React Icons for a consistent and minimalist design.
- Maintain a clean and minimalist layout in the style of Shopify, optimized for mobile-first responsiveness.
- Use subtle transitions and animations for button presses and page navigation to improve user experience.
